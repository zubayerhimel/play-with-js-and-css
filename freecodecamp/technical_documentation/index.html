            Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by
            Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of
            platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of
            UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This
            reference will take you through simple and practical approaches
            while learning Java Programming language.

            Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a
            great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software
            Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
            learning Java Programming:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Object Oriented</b> − In Java, everything is an Object. Java
              can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Platform Independent</b> - Unlike many other programming
              languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not
              compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform
              independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web
              and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform
              it is being run on.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Simple</b> - Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you
              understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to
              master.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Secure</b> - With Java's secure feature it enables to develop
              virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are
              based on public-key encryption.
            </li>
          </ul>

            If you are still willing to set up your environment for Java
            programming language, then this section guides you on how to
            download and set up Java on your machine. Following are the steps to
            set up the environment. Java SE is freely available from the link
            Download Java. You can download a version based on your operating
            system. Follow the instructions to download Java and run the .exe to
            install Java on your machine. Once you installed Java on your
            machine, you will need to set environment variables to point to
            correct installation directories −
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Setting Up the Path for Windows Assuming you have installed Java in
            c:\Program Files\java\jdk directory − Right-click on 'My Computer'
            and select 'Properties'. Click the 'Environment variables' button
            under the 'Advanced' tab. Now, alter the 'Path' variable so that it
            also contains the path to the Java executable. Example, if the path
            is currently set to 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32', then change your path to
            read 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32;c:\Program Files\java\jdk\bin'.
          </p>

          <h2>byte</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer
            </li>
            <li>Minimum value is -128 (-2^7)</li>
            <li>Maximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)</li>
            <li>Default value is 0</li>
            <li>
              Byte data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in
              place of integers, since a byte is four times smaller than an
              integer.
            </li>
            <li>Example: byte a = 100, byte b = -50</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>short</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer</li>
            <li>Minimum value is -32,768 (-2^15)</li>
            <li>Maximum value is 32,767 (inclusive) (2^15 -1)</li>
            <li>
              Short data type can also be used to save memory as byte data type.
              A short is 2 times smaller than an integer
            </li>
            <li>Default value is 0.</li>
            <li>Example: short s = 10000, short r = -20000</li>
          </ul>

          <header>Variable types</header>
          <p>
            A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can
            manipulate. Each variable in Java has a specific type, which
            determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range
            of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of
            operations that can be applied to the variable. You must declare all
            variables before they can be used. Following is the basic form of a
            variable declaration −
            <code
              >data type variable [ = value][, variable [ = value] ...] ;</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Here data type is one of Java's datatypes and variable is the name
            of the variable. To declare more than one variable of the specified
            type, you can use a comma-separated list. Following are valid
            examples of variable declaration and initialization in Java −
            <code
              >int a, b, c; // Declares three ints, a, b, and c. <br />int a =
              10, b = 10; // Example of initialization <br />byte B = 22; //
              initializes a byte type variable B. <br />double pi = 3.14159; //
              declares and assigns a value of PI. <br />char a = 'a'; // the
              char variable a iis initialized with value 'a'</code
            >
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Loop">
          <header>Loop</header>
          <p>
            There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code
            several number of times. In general, statements are executed
            sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first,
            followed by the second, and so on.
          </p>
          <br />
          <code>
            for(declaration : expression) { // Statements }
          </code>
          <br />
          <p>
            Declaration − The newly declared block variable, is of a type
            compatible with the elements of the array you are accessing. The
            variable will be available within the for block and its value would
            be the same as the current array element. Expression − This
            evaluates to the array you need to loop through. The expression can
            be an array variable or method call that returns an array.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence
            of characters. In Java programming language, strings are treated as
            objects. The Java platform provides the String class to create and
            manipulate strings.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Creating Strings</h2>
          <p>The most direct way to create a string is to write −</p>
          <br />
          <code>String greeting = "Hello world!";</code><br /><br />
          <p>
            Whenever it encounters a string literal in your code, the compiler
            creates a String object with its value in this case, "Hello world!'.
            As with any other object, you can create String objects by using the
            new keyword and a constructor. The String class has 11 constructors
            that allow you to provide the initial value of the string using
            different sources, such as an array of characters.
          </p>
          <code>hello.</code>
          <br />
          <pre>
public class StringDemo {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };
        String helloString = new String(helloArray);
        System.out.println( helloString );
    }
}
          </pre>
